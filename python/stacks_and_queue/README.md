# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

[Stacks Code](python/stacks_and_queue/stacks/stacks.py)
[Stacks Test](python/tests/test_stacks.py)

[Queue Code](python/stacks_and_queue/queues/queue.py)
[Queue Tests](python/tests/test_queue.py)

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

### Node

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.

### Stack

- Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
  - This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
  - The class should contain the following methods:
  - push
    - Arguments: value
    - adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.

- **pop**
  - Arguments: none
  - Returns: the value from node from the top of the stack
  - Removes the node from the top of the stack
  - Should raise exception when called on empty stack

- **peek**
  - Arguments: none
  - Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack
  - Should raise exception when called on empty stack

- **isEmpty**
  - Arguments: none
  - Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

### Queue

- Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
  - This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
  - The class should contain the following methods:

- **enqueue**
  - Arguments: value
  - adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.

- **dequeue**
  - Arguments: none
  - Returns: the value from node from the front of the queue
  - Removes the node from the front of the queue
  - Should raise exception when called on empty queue

- **peek**
  - Arguments: none
  - Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue
  - Should raise exception when called on empty stack

- **is empty**
  - Arguments: none
  - Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Big O:

**Stacks**

- Pop
  - Time: O(1)
- Peek
  - Time: O(1)
- isEmpty
  - Time: O(1)

**Queues**

- Enqueue
  - Time: O(1)
- Dequeue
  - Time: O(1)
- Peek
  - Time: O(1)
- isEmpty
    Time: O(1)
