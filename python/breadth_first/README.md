## Approach and Efficiency

Breadth first traversal uses a queue to keep track of the nodes. We initialize our queue with the root of the tree. Then start a while loop while the queue is not empty. We will dequeue, then enqueue that dequeued items left and right property. Then push the value into a result list. Then return that result list.
